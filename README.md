## Overview
Coding Contest Watchdog is a web application designed to deliver live updates on forthcoming coding competitions across diverse platforms. It employs a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to offer an intuitive and adaptable user interface. My motivation for embarking on this project was to gain hands-on experience with Fetch API and delve into the world of JavaScript promises.

## Features

- Real-time updates: The application uses AJAX requests to keep the contest information up to date.
- Responsive design: Built with Bootstrap, the user interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- User-friendly interface: Search bar that dynamically updates contest details on each keystroke and a clear contest details presentation.
